# COMP472_SOENTISTS_MP2
Mini-Project 2 for COMP 472 Fall 2022

GitHub Repo URL: https://github.com/DrakeHunterK7/COMP472_SOENTISTS_MP2

Instructions on running the program:
1) Clone the repo on your PC
2) Make sure you're on the main branch
3) Open the project in any python IDE/Interpreter. We used Pycharm so that would work best.
4) In your IDE, open "RushHour.py" in the root folder. 
5) Simple run this file and it will automatically begin reading the puzzles from the "puzzle-input.txt" file in the SampleInputOutput/Output folder, and run the algorithms on it. 
6) Once the program has finished, you will see approximately 450 output files in the Output folder in the root directory. You will also see an excel file generated in the root directory called "50_solutions_results" which is a spreadsheet containing all the data about the algorithms performance with the 50 puzzles.
